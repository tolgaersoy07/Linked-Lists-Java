This project is a LinkedList application written in java. In this project, which I did to improve my skills with data structures and algorithms, there are many features that LinkedList must support. A random test algorithm has also been written to test automatically. When the program runs, a random array is created and this array is converted into a LinkedList. Then, all the features of LinkedList are run one by one and given as output to the console screen.

### Features of the Project

-Creating a LinkedList

-Delete element from LinkedList

-Merge 2 LinkedLists

-LinkedList printing

-Reverse LinkedList

-Sorting elements in LinkedList
